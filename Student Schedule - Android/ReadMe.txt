This project was made for my Android development class.  It allows the student to track classes for each semester, 
the professors, contact info, and notes. I used a Samsung Galaxy s9 device and a Pixel (1) AVD for development (1080x1920) 
resolution and 420dpi. I developed on Android 28 SDK(Pie) & my min is set to SDK 14. Make sure that your Android Studio is 3.4 or 
the project will not load into Android Studio.
